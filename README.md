# APIProject
Basic API Project on Java implementing Pircbot with 2 APIs
The bot requires the pircbot and gson libraries to work. It implements 2 APIs including openweather api and uselessfacts api. The bot connects to freenode.net to channel #osmang and will only respond to Hello, facts, and weather <ZIPCODE>. The weather functionality likely doesn't work as the openweather api key code is time limited and is likely expired. If you want to see it work, you can change the key in line 55 in file MyBot.java with a new key code from openweather which should be free.
